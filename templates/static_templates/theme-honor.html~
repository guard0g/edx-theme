Overbrook School seeks to permeate the school day with the presence of Christ. It is reasonable,therefore, that our school expects and 
requires honorable conduct at all times. Cheating,plagiarism, lying, stealing, forgery of signatures on test/documents, and failure to 
respect school property or persons are serious breaches of the conduct code.
